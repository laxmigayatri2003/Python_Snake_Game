# Python_Snake_Game
The game involved navigating a snake to eat food and grow longer while  avoiding obstacles and its own tail. The project required implementing  various features such as movement controls, food generation and  collision detection. I utilized the Turtles module to draw the gameâ€™s  graphics and animations, resulting in a visually appealing game.
